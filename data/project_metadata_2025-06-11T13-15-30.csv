683bf111c639bfed81a17061,HYDRO ELECTRIC POWER-DRIVEN IRRIGATION SYSTEM,"Project Overview CHAPTER ONE The Tanzania Government's ambitious plan to bolster the agriculture and animal husbandry sectors in the coming years is a testament to the crucial role these industries play in our nation's economic and social advancement. Despite their significance, these sectors grapple with formidable challenges, chief among them being the inadequate production of crops and goods. This inadequacy stems from the widespread absence of proper irrigation schemes in many areas or the prohibitively high costs associated with existing schemes. Consequently, finding a solution that not only addresses these challenges but also empowers farmers to affordably implement and sustain irrigation systems is imperative for unlocking the potential for high agricultural productivity and community development. Central to this solution is the adoption of renewable energy sources, which offer unparalleled reliability compared to traditional generators reliant on fluctuating fuel prices. By harnessing renewable energy, such as hydroelectric power, we can provide...",To design and implement Hydro Electric Power (HEP) Driven Irrigation system.; To gather requirements for the HEP driven irrigation system.; To design the HEP production plant and the monitoring mobile application of the HEP driven irrigation system.; To implement the mobile application and HEP production plant in HEP driven irrigation system.; To evaluate the HEP driven irrigation system regarding to its performance.,Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DoCS&E),2023,,,

However, during the process of SON topology discovery, SON controllers tend to suffer from the topology poisoning attacks due to a lack of authentication. Existing methods can hardly solve the problems of SON topology poisoning attacks in a comprehensive and lightweight manner. To fill this gap, we propose TMSA(topology management services authenticator), a lightweight and efficient SDN topology services authentication scheme. Specifically, we first establish a security threat model to analyze key service vulnerabilities in the SON controller. Then, we design two verification strategies (i.e., host location verification and link verification) to cope with the host hijacking attack and link fabrication attack, respectively. In more detail, our host location verification strategy is based on the path tracking and asynchronous rollback technique, while our link verification strategy is designed using the public...",To develop the topology management services authenticator (TMSA) in the faucet SDN controller.; To identify technical challenges of faucet SDN controller Topology Management Services and assessing security issues.; To design TMSA (Topology Management Services Authenticator).; To test and implement the designed topology management services authenticator.,Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DoCS&E),2023,,,
