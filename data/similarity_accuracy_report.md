## Detailed Results

| Project ID | Project Title | Manual Similarity | Embedding Similarity | Metadata Similarity | Combined Similarity | Embedding Error | Metadata Error | Combined Error |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|


## Conclusion

Based on the evaluation results, the combined similarity approach shows the lowest mean error and appears to be the most accurate method for predicting similarity between proposals and existing projects.

## Recommendations

Consider further refinements to the similarity calculation methods to reduce error rates. This could include adjusting weights, thresholds, or exploring alternative embedding models.
