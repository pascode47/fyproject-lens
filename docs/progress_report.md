# Project Progress Report - FYProjectLens

**Date:** May 4, 2025

## Milestones Achieved

*   **System Architecture Defined:** The overall system architecture, including data flow, component interactions (Frontend: Angular, Backend: Node.js/Express, Database: MongoDB likely, based on typical Mongoose usage with `.js` models), and technology stack, has been designed and largely implemented. Docker setup (`docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`) is in place for containerization.
*   **Core Backend Infrastructure:** Significant progress has been made on the backend, including database models (User, Project, Programme, Analysis, SimilarityResult), API endpoints for authentication, users, projects, programmes, and similarity checking (`routes/`, `controllers/`). Middleware for authentication and error handling is implemented.
*   **Similarity Checking Service (Initial Implementation):** The backend service for similarity checking, including API endpoints and data models, has been developed. Frontend components for uploading projects and viewing similarity results are functional.
*   **Recommendation Service (Foundation):** The basic infrastructure for project recommendations is in place (`utils/recommendations.js`, related frontend services and components).
*   **User-Facing Web Application:** A substantial portion of the Angular frontend application is built, featuring user authentication, project browsing, project details view, project upload, similarity results display, user profile, and admin sections for managing users and projects.

## Remaining Tasks

*   **Backend Refinements:** Finalize any remaining backend API endpoints, optimize database queries, and enhance error handling.
*   **AI Algorithm Enhancement:** Refine and optimize the AI algorithms for both similarity checking and project recommendations. Improve text pre-processing and potentially explore alternative algorithms for better accuracy.
*   **Frontend Polish:** Complete any remaining UI features, improve styling and responsiveness across different devices, and enhance user experience based on feedback.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Conduct thorough testing, including:
    *   Unit testing for backend and frontend components.
    *   Integration testing between frontend, backend, and AI services.
    *   End-to-end testing simulating user workflows.
    *   Performance testing under load.
    *   Usability testing to gather user feedback.
*   **Documentation:** Improve inline code comments and create comprehensive documentation for APIs and system architecture.
*   **Deployment:** Finalize deployment strategy and deploy the application to a production environment.

| Objective                                                                                                                            | Status      | Completion (%) | Notes                                                                                                |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------- | :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Design the overall system architecture, including data flow, component interactions, and technology stack selection.              | Completed   | 100%           | Architecture defined and implemented.                                                                |
| 2. Develop the core backend infrastructure for the project repository, encompassing database design, data access layers, and API endpoints. | In Progress | 90%            | Core backend is functional, minor refinements might be needed.                                      |
| 3. Implement the AI-driven similarity checking service, including text pre-processing, algorithm selection, and similarity score generation. | In Progress | 80%            | Basic service implemented, AI algorithm refinement and thorough testing pending.                     |
| 4. Develop the AI-powered project recommendation service, incorporating data analysis, trend identification, and recommendation generation. | In Progress | 70%            | Foundation laid, AI logic needs enhancement and evaluation.                                         |
| 5. Build the user-facing web application with intuitive interfaces for project submission, similarity checking, and recommendation access. | In Progress | 90%            | Most UI features are implemented, requires final polish and potentially some minor feature additions. |
| 6. Conduct comprehensive testing and evaluation of the entire platform, assessing performance, usability, and impact on project outcomes. | Started     | 30%            | Basic unit tests exist, comprehensive end-to-end, performance, and usability testing required.       |
